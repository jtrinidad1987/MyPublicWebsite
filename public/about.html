        <p>Greetings! I'm Jason Trinidad, a proud native of beautiful and sunny Puerto Rico. With a rich background spanning over a decade in software development, I've immersed myself in various programming languages and frameworks. However, my true passion lies in the dynamic realm of application security.

            My journey into the captivating world of AppSec began during my Master's studies at George Mason. What started as a convenient elective course quickly became the most enriching and rewarding class of my academic journey. With over 5 years of hands-on experience in Professional Services and as a Sales Engineer for leading AppSec vendors, I've honed my skills and expertise to navigate the ever-evolving landscape of application security.</p>
