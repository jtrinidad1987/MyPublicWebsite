    <p>Greetings! I'm Jason Trinidad, a proud native of beautiful and sunny Puerto Rico. With a rich background spanning over a decade in software development, 
        I've immersed myself in various programming languages and frameworks. However, my true passion lies in the dynamic realm of application security.
    </br></br>
        My journey into the captivating world of AppSec began during my Master's studies at George Mason. What started as a convenient elective course quickly 
        became the most enriching and rewarding class of my academic journey. With over 5 years of hands-on experience in Professional Services and as a Sales Engineer for leading AppSec vendors, I've honed my skills and expertise to navigate the ever-evolving landscape of application security.
