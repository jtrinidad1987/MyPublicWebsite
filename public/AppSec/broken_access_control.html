    <h1>Broken Access Control and Remediation</h1>

    <div id="explanation">
        <h2>What is Broken Access Control?</h2>
        <p>Broken Access Control is a security vulnerability that allows unauthorized users to access restricted resources or perform unauthorized actions within a web application. It occurs when access controls are not properly implemented or enforced, allowing attackers to bypass authentication mechanisms and gain unauthorized access to sensitive data or functionality.</p>
    </div>

    <div id="attack-example">
        <h2>Example of Broken Access Control</h2>
        <p>Consider a web application that manages user profiles:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>User A should only be able to view and edit their own profile.</li>
            <li>User B, however, is able to access User A's profile by modifying the URL directly.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This lack of proper access controls allows User B to view or modify User A's profile, leading to unauthorized access to sensitive information.</p>
    </div>

    <div id="attack-output">
        <h2>Remediation</h2>
        <p>To mitigate Broken Access Control vulnerabilities, web developers should:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Implement proper access controls: Ensure that access controls are properly defined and enforced throughout the application.</li>
            <li>Use role-based access control (RBAC): Assign specific roles and permissions to users based on their roles and responsibilities.</li>
            <li>Implement least privilege principle: Only grant users the minimum level of access required to perform their tasks.</li>
            <li>Regularly audit and review access controls: Continuously monitor and review access controls to identify and address any misconfigurations or vulnerabilities.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
